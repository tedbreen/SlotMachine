# Espresso Bar Slot Machine

Engineers and designers enjoy a healthy dose of caffeine in the morning. They like to drink coffee, tea, or espresso. This slot machine awards lucky players one of these random beverages.

This slot machine has three reels:
* The first reel has a coffee maker, a teapot, and an espresso machine.
* The second reel has a coffee filter, a tea strainer, and an espresso tamper.
* The third reel has coffee grounds, loose tea, and ground espresso beans.

When the lever is pulled (simulated with the click of a button), the slot machine goes into action. Each reel spins and randomly stops on one of the three options. If the user is lucky, the three reels will line up and the user will be rewarded with a tasty hot beverage. The result will be displayed below the buttons. For example, if the reels show coffee maker, coffee filter, and coffee grounds, the user wins a cup of coffee.
